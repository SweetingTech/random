These are just files I have that help me out. I'll add to them as I make more stuff I think might just be helpful to people.

Password Generator:
- This is a simple password generator that I made in Python. It generates a password of a specified length and complexity. Because lord knows I can't remember all the passwords I have.
I think it would prob be a good idea to make a password manager, but I'm too lazy to do that right now. 


Icon Maker:
- This is a simple icon maker that I made in Python. I was tired of having to log into 5.6 billion different pages to get one icon. So I just built the damn thing. I was going to make it a web app, 
but I don't feel like it so I made it a little pop up window. It's not the prettiest thing in the world, but it works. It has spinning, dots, pulse, bars. I was going to put letter. May still do that.
